Coffee Quality Analysis using Power BI   
• Performed data cleaning, transformation, and preparation on a dataset from the Coffee Quality     
Institute (CQI), ensuring data integrity and accuracy.   
• Developed interactive dashboards and data visualizations to analyze sensory attributes, 
processing methods, and regional origins, providing actionable insights into coffee quality trends.   
• Utilized advanced features of Power BI such as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and What-If 
analysis to explore the impact of different variables on coffee quality scores.   
• Identified key factors influencing total cup points through correlation analysis and presented 
insights to stakeholders for decision-making.   
• Find out what is the best coffee processing methods, how many defects are there and coffee grade 
trend analysis.
